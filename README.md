# Artificial-Horizon-with-SSD1306-and-MPU6050-on-STM32F103VC
This project contains some function for SSD1306 OLED controller and MPU6050 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope module. Both chips communicate with STM32F103VC mcu through two separate I2C buses using bare-metal programming. The main feature is an artificial horizon.
